The Summer Intensive (SI) at All Star Code (ASC) focuses on web development (HTML/CSS/JS) as the main content of the curriculum. Accordingly, the instructional staff should be proficient in web development as well. However, candidates do NOT need to be full-stack web developers, nor do they need to know the entire curriculum before being hired.  

   When grouping instructional staff members, having only members proficient in front-end development would result in a deficient cohort. We want to avoid such instances, so please view the following technical test more like a placement exercise. There is no wrong answer. This project will also serve as a point of discussion during your interview, where we’ll discuss the choices you’ve made and your overall approach. 

# Prompt
   Create an example personal website. This website could be used to show students in the SI what a personal website looks like as a way of spurring ideas for their own personal websites. If you’re comfortable making one of yourself, that’s completely acceptable, too, but not necessary. 

# Content
   If you decide to use placeholder content, you can use Lorem Ipsum for text and whatever pictures you want as image assets.  

   You do NOT have to use Bootstrap or jQuery, but you can if you’d like.  

   I’ve included some image assets, as well as jQuery and Bootstrap (in ‘lib’) in the following github repo as a starting point https://github.com/mahdiASC/testWebsite. You are NOT required to use the assets or the library (‘lib’) for this project, but I’m providing them for your convenience. Feel free to use your own assets and libraries.

# Submission
   Send your ASC contact a link to your github hosted website (free). If you have any questions regarding the assignment, submission, github, etc. please send inquiries to mahdi@allstarcode.org.
